🧠 Psychometric Test App
Measure your Emotional Strength, Resilience, Growth Mindset & Overthinking Patterns — Scientifically.
🌿 Overview

Psychometric Test App is an interactive, browser-based psychological self-assessment platform designed to help users explore and understand their emotional and cognitive patterns through evidence-based questionnaires.
It provides category-wise insights (Emotional Intelligence, Resilience, Growth Mindset, Overthinking, etc.) and generates personalized reports powered by a structured scoring system and scientifically informed analysis.

Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app runs completely client-side — no login, no data collection, and 100% privacy.

🔍 Background & Scientific Foundation

The app draws inspiration from the fields of psychometrics, behavioral neuroscience, and positive psychology — domains that study the quantifiable aspects of human thought and behavior.

Below is a summary of the scientific grounding behind each test category:

🧭 1. Emotional Intelligence (EI)

Based on the models by Daniel Goleman (1995) and Mayer, Salovey & Caruso, emotional intelligence represents one’s ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions — both one’s own and others’.
Studies link high EI to better relationships, leadership, empathy, and mental health stability.

🪴 2. Growth Mindset

This section is inspired by Dr. Carol Dweck’s theory of mindset, which differentiates between fixed and growth-oriented thinking.
A growth mindset leads to greater learning adaptability, persistence, and performance under challenge.

💪 3. Resilience

Resilience measures how effectively individuals recover from stress, trauma, or failure.
It’s linked to adaptive coping mechanisms, emotional regulation, and neural flexibility in the prefrontal cortex–amygdala network.

🔄 4. Overthinking & Cognitive Loops

This domain examines rumination patterns, mental replay, and self-focused thought loops — processes often associated with anxiety and cognitive overload.
Understanding one’s tendency to overthink can lead to better self-regulation, mindfulness, and decision-making.
