Overthinking - Level 2
Frequent Overthinking
Your assessment results indicate frequent overthinking. While you have moments of mental quiet, you easily fall into cycles of rumination and worry, especially when stressed or facing uncertainty.

Key Characteristics
Situational rumination; triggered by specific stressors (e.g., work, relationships)

"What if" thinking is a common default

Decision-making is slow and laborious, involving excessive list-making and seeking opinions

Difficulty letting go of thoughts once they start

Awareness of the pattern but feeling unable to break it consistently

Impact on Daily Life
At this level, you might experience:

Periods of high productivity followed by periods of mental gridlock

Moderate anxiety that fluctuates with life events

Occasional sleepless nights before big deadlines or events

Frustration with your own mental processes

Development Strategy
Immediate Focus Areas:

Cognitive Defusion - Learn to see your thoughts as just "thoughts," not facts or commands ("I'm having the thought that I will fail").

The "Next Action" Rule - When stuck, identify the very next physical, small action you can take and do it.

Mindfulness Meditation - Start with 5 minutes daily to practice observing thoughts without getting caught in them.

Recommended Exercises:

Label your thoughts: "That's a worry thought," "That's a planning thought," "That's a judgment thought."

Use a "decision deadline": for medium-stakes decisions, give yourself a fixed amount of time (e.g., 24 hours) to decide, then you must act.

Practice a "mental shutdown" ritual at the end of your workday (e.g., make a to-do list for tomorrow and then visualize closing a mental door).

Long-term Growth Path
With dedicated effort, you can expect to reduce the frequency and duration of overthinking episodes within 6-12 months.
