## Emotional Intelligence - Level 1
Very Low Proficiency

Your results indicate a very low level of emotional intelligence — meaning you may struggle with identifying, understanding, and managing emotions in yourself and others. The positive side is that emotional intelligence is not fixed; it can grow significantly with self-awareness and practice.

**Science Snapshot**
- Only about 36% of people can accurately identify their emotions in real time (Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, 2020).
- TalentSmart research shows individuals with low EI face 60–70% higher workplace stress and 3x more conflict.
- Brain imaging studies link this level to weaker prefrontal–amygdala connectivity, making emotional impulses harder to regulate.
- Consistent EI training can raise emotional recognition accuracy by up to 40% within 6 months (Goleman, 2018).

**Key Characteristics**
- Limited awareness of emotional triggers and body cues.
- Difficulty understanding others’ feelings or tone.
- Strong emotional reactivity under stress.
- Empathy often fades during conflict or pressure.

**Impact on Daily Life**
- Misunderstandings in relationships and conversations.
- Feeling easily overwhelmed by criticism.
- Emotional outbursts followed by regret or fatigue.
- Struggles in teamwork or emotionally charged environments.

**Development Strategy**
- Begin with basic emotion identification: name what you feel, don’t judge it.
- Practice daily mindfulness to notice sensations that accompany emotions.
- Pause before reacting — count to three or take a slow breath.
- Learn the emotional language: words like “tense,” “drained,” “hopeful,” “uneasy” deepen awareness.

**Recommended Exercises**
- ✍️ Keep an emotion journal for 5 minutes daily.
- 🎬 Identify emotions of 3 movie or series characters every day.
- 💬 Use “I feel…” statements in real conversations.
- 🧘 Try 2 minutes of breath focus after strong emotions.

**Growth Path**
- Within 3–6 months, basic emotional awareness and labeling can improve by 25–40%.
- This creates measurable changes in empathy, patience, and social understanding.
- As your prefrontal cortex gains better control over the amygdala, you’ll feel calmer and more balanced.
- This is your foundation — progress from reaction to reflection begins here.
