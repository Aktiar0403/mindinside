## Emotional Intelligence - Level 2
Low Proficiency

You show emerging awareness of emotions but still find it hard to interpret or regulate them effectively. You can occasionally identify what you or others feel, but reactions may still override reflection in stressful or complex situations.

**Science Snapshot**
- Around 1 in 4 adults operate in this developing emotional range (Yale EI Research, 2020).
- Low-EI individuals show 30–40% higher cortisol reactivity during interpersonal stress (Harvard Mind–Body Lab, 2018).
- Early emotional labeling practice strengthens anterior insula activity — the brain’s “emotion awareness” hub.
- Improvement from Level 2 to Level 3 typically occurs within 4–8 months of consistent training.

**Key Characteristics**
- Occasional ability to identify feelings but difficulty staying objective.
- Limited emotional vocabulary — emotions often described as “good/bad.”
- Empathy present but inconsistent, especially under pressure.
- Tendency to withdraw or overreact when misunderstood.

**Impact on Daily Life**
- Communication breakdowns during emotional conversations.
- Avoidance of conflict or over-defensiveness in feedback situations.
- Mood fluctuations that affect decision-making or motivation.
- Difficulty supporting others emotionally, even with good intentions.

**Development Strategy**
- Expand your emotional vocabulary — name subtle feelings (e.g., frustrated, tense, relieved).
- Begin reflective journaling: note *why* emotions arise, not just *what* you feel.
- Practice short daily self-check-ins (“What am I feeling and why?”).
- Replace reactive talk (“You made me angry”) with ownership statements (“I felt hurt when…”).

**Recommended Exercises**
- 🧭 End each day with a 3-line reflection: emotion → trigger → response.
- 🎧 Practice active listening: repeat others’ feelings before replying.
- 💬 Use emotional scaling: rate your emotion 1–10 to notice intensity.
- 🧘‍♀️ Try 5-minute guided mindfulness sessions focused on sensations.

**Growth Path**
- With consistent reflection and labeling, emotional accuracy and control can increase 30–50% within 6–9 months.
- You’ll start recognizing early signals of frustration, allowing calmer responses.
- Relationships will improve as empathy stabilizes and reactivity lessens.
- This stage builds the emotional literacy foundation needed for empathy and adaptability at higher levels.
