Emotional Intelligence - Level 2
Low Proficiency
Your assessment results indicate a low level of emotional intelligence. You have a basic awareness of emotions but may struggle to apply this understanding effectively in real-time situations.

Key Characteristics
Emerging self-awareness of strong emotions (e.g., anger, excitement)

Can identify basic emotions in others (e.g., happy, sad) if they are clearly expressed

Reactive emotional regulation; you can sometimes calm down after an outburst

Developing empathy; you can understand others' perspectives if they are explained to you

Impact on Daily Life
At this level, you might experience:

Occasional social friction due to misreading cues

Feeling overwhelmed by complex emotional situations

Difficulty providing effective emotional support to others

Inconsistent performance in collaborative tasks

Development Strategy
Immediate Focus Areas:

Emotional Patterns - Start noticing what triggers your primary emotions.

Active Listening - Focus on the words and tone others use without immediately planning your response.

Body Language Awareness - Begin observing non-verbal cues in conversations.

Recommended Exercises:

Use a "feelings wheel" to expand your emotional vocabulary beyond basic terms.

After a conversation, write down one thing the other person might have been feeling.

Practice a "stop-breathe-observe" technique before responding in a disagreement.

Long-term Growth Path
With dedicated effort, you can expect to reach a moderate level of EI within 6-12 months, leading to more stable relationships and reduced interpersonal conflict.
