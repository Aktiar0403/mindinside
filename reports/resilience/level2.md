Resilience - Level 2
Low Proficiency
Your assessment results indicate low resilience. You can handle minor stressors but are often knocked off course by significant challenges and may dwell on negative events.

Key Characteristics
Fragile recovery; it takes a long time to bounce back from adversity

Limited coping toolkit; you may rely on one or two strategies (e.g., distraction) that aren't always effective

Self-doubt in your ability to handle difficulties

Rumination; you get stuck thinking about what went wrong

Impact on Daily Life
At this level, you might experience:

Feeling "stuck" in a negative situation for days or weeks

Avoidance of new challenges due to fear of failure

Relationships strained by your stress responses

Inconsistent performance at work or school under pressure

Development Strategy
Immediate Focus Areas:

Cognitive Reframing - Practice identifying and challenging one negative thought.

Build a Coping Menu - Brainstorm a list of 5-10 healthy coping strategies (e.g., walk, call a friend, listen to music).

Celebrate Small Wins - Acknowledge every time you get through a tough day.

Recommended Exercises:

Keep a "resilience log": write down a challenge and one thing you did to cope, no matter how small.

Practice the "Best Possible Self" exercise for 5 minutes: visualize yourself having overcome a current difficulty.

Identify a past challenge you overcame and list the strengths you used to do it.

Long-term Growth Path
With dedicated effort, you can expect to reach a moderate level of resilience within 6-12 months, leading to faster recovery times and more adaptive coping.
