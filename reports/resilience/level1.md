Resilience - Level 1
Very Low Proficiency

Key Characteristics
Low stress tolerance; even minor hassles feel like major crises

Difficulty bouncing back from disappointments or failures

Impact on Daily Life
At this level, you might experience:

Frequent feelings of anxiety and helplessness

Procrastination and avoidance of challenges

Giving up easily when faced with obstacles

Physical and emotional exhaustion from stress

Development Strategy
Immediate Focus Areas:

Stress Identification - Learn to recognize the early physical signs of stress.

Basic Self-Care - Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and hydration.

Micro-Recovery - Introduce tiny, 1-minute breaks into your day to breathe and reset.

Recommended Exercises:

Practice "box breathing" (inhale 4 sec, hold 4 sec, exhale 4 sec, hold 4 sec) for one minute when feeling stressed.

Write down one small thing you can control in a difficult situation.

At the end of the day, list one thing that went okay, no matter how small.

Long-term Growth Path
With consistent practice, you can build a foundational level of resilience within 3-6 months, leading to feeling slightly more in control during daily challenges.
