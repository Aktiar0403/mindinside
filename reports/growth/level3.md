Become a Mentor - Teaching others reinforces your own growth mindset beliefs.

Recommended Exercises:

When you face a trigger, have a prepared growth mindset mantra ("This is hard, but my brain is growing stronger").

Interview someone you admire about their struggles and how they overcame them.

Keep a "Learning Journey" journal, documenting the process of learning a new skill from start to proficiency.
